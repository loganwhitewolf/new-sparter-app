# Project

## What This Is

Sparter is a personal finance app for the Italian market. It supports email/password and Google/GitHub OAuth authentication with account linking, transaction and expense management, import history, CSV/Excel/PDF import flows backed by Cloudflare R2, user-managed categories, a year-scoped dashboard overview (grouped bar chart, 4 KPI cards, per-month movers drill-down, filter chips by income type and expense nature, FlowNature education popovers, uncategorized nudge), deviation analysis, a regex discovery pipeline (standalone post-categorization service with dedup gates, IDOR-guarded retroactive platform-scoped apply, and a reusable Files-table trigger), a guided first-import onboarding flow, a unified subcategory picker bottom sheet across all 7 selection surfaces, a collapsible icon-rail sidebar, structured logging, and a health endpoint. The app is deployed on Vercel (operator action) or runnable locally with a Supabase/R2 stack.

## Core Value

The user can safely import real bank transactions, see where their money goes categorized by month, and instantly spot deviations from their baseline spending — all running on a zero-cost personal deploy with real database persistence and repeatable migration/deploy procedures.

## Project Shape

- **Complexity:** complex
- **Why:** The app spans Next.js server runtime, Better Auth (email/password + OAuth), Drizzle/Postgres, Cloudflare R2, production environment variables, migrations, categorization tiers, dashboard deviation analytics, and external free-tier platform limits.

## Current State

All milestones M001–v2.2 (Phases 1–57) complete. The app now has:
- Email/password + Google/GitHub OAuth auth with account linking (link/unlink from /settings/profile)
- Import management, categorization (Tier 1 regex, Tier 2 history, Tier 3 AI gated)
- Pattern suggestions: detect recurring uncategorized descriptions → review and promote during analysis → re-run post-import from `/import/[fileId]/suggestions`
- Category settings with user-owned and system categories/subcategories on the v2.0 nature→direction model: `direction`(4) + `nature`(8) FK-backed lookup tables, `sub_category.nature_id` FK, `direction.included_in_totals` as the single totals-exclusion source (`category.type`/`flow_nature`/`amount_sign`/`exclude_from_totals` removed)
- Direction-based dashboard/surfaces (v2.0): 4-direction view with allocation bucket, algebraic-sum aggregation, cascade options + table filters keyed by direction
- Explicit transaction pairing (v2.0): 1:1 order↔refund linking with algebraic netting across all 8 dashboard aggregation sites, searchable counterpart picker, inline signed-net badge + popover, and unlink-restores-baseline
- Redesigned year-scoped `/dashboard/overview` (v1.16): grouped Entrate/Uscite bar chart with always-on compact labels, 4 KPI cards (Entrate/Uscite/Bilancio/Tasso risparmio) with YTD-vs-prior delta and sentiment reading lines, filter chips for income type and expense nature, FlowNature ⓘ education popovers, inline amber uncategorized nudge with localStorage dismiss, per-month movers drill-down (click bar → top movers panel, humanized Italian copy, "spesa nuova" for new spend, defaults to last month with data)
- First-import onboarding (5-step flow: upload → overview → education → categorize → outro); routing gate via RSC layout
- Unified subcategory picker (vaul bottom sheet, type chips, master-detail rail, most-used section) across all 7 selection surfaces; pattern form reduced to regex + description + picker
- Collapsible icon-rail sidebar with localStorage-persisted state; Topbar removed; BottomNav 5th Impostazioni entry; ThemeToggle in SettingsHub
- R2 upload services, Drizzle migrations, operational health diagnostics
- Zero-cost deploy runbook at `docs/deploy/vercel-supabase-r2.md`
- Standalone Expense (v2.4): inline "spesa a sé / non aggregare" action in the categorization flow on any transaction; `detachTransactionToDedicatedExpense` accepts `subCategoryId` and persists it on both the multi-tx and new single-tx in-place re-hash paths; `SINGLE_TRANSACTION_EXPENSE` guard removed; row-title display precedence fixed to `customTitle → expenseTitle → description` (checkpoint bug fix, `transaction.description`/hash/aggregation/Tier 2 untouched)

Live Vercel/Supabase/R2 deploy is operator-pending (R038, R039, R041). Code, config, and runbook are complete.

## Current Milestone: v2.5 — Detail Pages

**Goal:** Uniform detail pages for the three core entities — `/transactions/[id]`,
`/expenses/[id]`, `/import/[fileId]` — as the single place to view and edit
everything editable (amount, date, title, category, notes, displayName), with
cross-references between entities and existing actions (cerca su internet,
categorizza, collega rimborso, spesa a sé) surfaced in place.

**Domain contract (grill 2026-07-05, locked in REQUIREMENTS.md):**
- `transactionHash`/`descriptionHash`/`description` are **immutable** — an edited
  transaction is still the same transaction to the importer (re-import dedups);
  `customTitle` is the rename mechanism.
- Amount/date edits **auto-reconcile** the linked expense's derived aggregates
  atomically; derived fields are never directly writable.
- Edits that would break a refund pair's opposite-sign invariant are **blocked
  with a message**, never silently unlinked.

**Phases:** 62 (transaction-edit-core, DET-01..04) → 63 (detail-pages-tx-expense,
DET-05..07) → 64 (file-detail-and-navigation, DET-08..09).

**Deferred:** description editing, bulk edit, revision history, SPLIT-01.

**Validated in Phase 62 (transaction-edit-core, 2026-07-05):** DET-01..04 — `updateTransaction`
service (amount/occurredAt/customTitle edit, hashes/description frozen, atomic expense
reconciliation, pair-guard blocking with Italian message) and `updateExpense` DAL extended
to be atomic and classification-history-aware, matching the categorize flow's semantics.
Backend + tests only, 16/16 must-haves verified. No UI yet — that's Phase 63.

**Validated in Phase 63 (detail-pages-tx-expense, 2026-07-05):** DET-05..07 — `/transactions/[id]`
and `/expenses/[id]` pages with pencil-inline editing (amount, date, title, notes, category),
ownership-scoped DAL queries returning 404-as-undefined, shared `DetailPageShell` layout, and
both tables' row menus wired to the new pages (old expense "dettagli"/"modifica" dialogs
retired). 9/9 must-haves verified, 48/48 tests passing. Code review found and fixed one blocker
(amount edit input seeded a currency-formatted string that failed re-save validation) plus four
smaller consistency issues.

**Validated in Phase 64 (file-detail-and-navigation, 2026-07-06):** DET-08..09 — `/import/[fileId]`
detail page (editable displayName, readonly platform/format/stats, linked transactions preview,
existing actions preserved) plus row-click/menu navigation wiring across all three tables and
consistent smart-back behavior. Shipped across 7 plans including two gap-closure rounds: 64-06
fixed a Client Cache reuse bug on `router.back()`, 64-07 fixed a code-review blocker (inline-edit
pencil invisible on all three detail pages — missing Tailwind `.group` ancestor) plus a bundled
smart-back reliability bug (`document.referrer` never updates across SPA navigations). 7/7
must-haves verified, all UAT passed, 13/13 security threats closed (0 open).

**v2.5 Detail Pages milestone shipped 2026-07-06** — all 3 phases (62-64) complete, 13/13 plans,
9/9 DET requirements validated.

## Last Shipped Milestone: v2.4 — Standalone Expense (shipped 2026-07-01, tag v2.4)

**Goal:** Give the user a way to isolate a single transaction from `descriptionHash` aggregation at categorization time — a general "treat as a standalone expense / do not aggregate" action — so shared-subscription reimbursements and ambiguous person-to-person inflows are categorized correctly without polluting the sender's aggregate or the Tier 2 history.

**Delivered (Phase 61, verified 2026-07-01, 8/8 must-haves):**
- Inline "standalone expense" action in the categorization flow: captures a title + subcategory and detaches the transaction into a dedicated expense with a synthetic `descriptionHash`. General — available on any transaction — not a counterparty category.
- Single-transaction in-place path that lifts the `SINGLE_TRANSACTION_EXPENSE` guard in `lib/services/transaction-detach.ts` by re-hashing the existing expense row (no new expense, no orphan).
- Checkpoint bug fix: row title now falls back `customTitle → expenseTitle → description` so a renamed standalone expense's title is reflected on the transaction row (previously stuck on the raw bank description).

**Decision contract:** LOCKED in `docs/adr/0016-shared-costs-net-by-subcategory-inflows-isolated-per-transaction.md` + `CONTEXT.md` (Standalone Expense entry). The option-A netting doctrine is already usable with zero code; this milestone builds only the isolation capability. Deferred: normalized Subscriptions view; split of a single inflow across subcategories.

**Status:** Phase 61 complete and verified. Milestone ready for `/gsd-complete-milestone v2.4` (tag) when desired — same pattern as v2.3.

## Last Shipped Milestone: v2.3 — Platform Identity & Format Ownership (shipped 2026-06-30)

**Goal:** Make Platform a globally shared, moderated identity (never user-owned) and move private ownership onto the Import Format, eliminating duplicate platforms and the seed id collision.

**Target features:**
- Platform is never user-owned: drop `platform.visibility`, rename `platform.ownerUserId` → `proposedByUserId`; review lifecycle via `reviewStatus` (pending = visible only to proposer; approved = shared with all). Existing private platforms migrated via backfill.
- Private Import Format decoupled from private Platform: `accessibleWhere` allows a user-owned format to be visible on a global/approved platform.
- Import wizard attaches a new private Import Format to an existing Platform when format detection fails; a new Platform is created only when none fits, and is born `pending`.
- Seed linkage by slug: seeded import formats reference the platform by slug (no hardcoded id); the Trade Republic id-8 collision is eliminated; runtime FK stays `platformId`.
- DescriptionStripPattern reference cleanup: docs/glossary (and any stale code/comments) reflect that the strip pattern lives on `import_format_version` (ADR 0013), not `platform`.

**Decision contract:** LOCKED in `docs/adr/0015-platform-global-moderated-format-private.md` + `CONTEXT.md` (Platform / Import Format entries). No discovery to redo. Deferred: operator approval UI (multi-user only).

## Last Shipped Milestone: v2.2 — PDF Import (shipped 2026-06-26)

**Goal:** Enable importing PDF bank statements (first real case: Trade Republic), starting with a refactor that separates the parsing contract from Platform identity.

**Delivered:**
- Import Format refactor: parsing contract moved from `platform` to `import_format_version` (ADR 0013); behavior-preserving — 7 CSV fixture hashes identical before/after regression test; `platform` is now pure identity.
- Trade Republic PDF import: per-bank template recognized by markers, normalized to `ParsedImportFile` with synthetic headers; amount sign via positional X coordinates (`unpdf`); "TRANSAZIONI SUL CONTO" section only; minimal `descriptionStripPattern` so recurring savings plan rows aggregate.

**Status:** Phases 56–57 complete. All 10 requirements satisfied. PR #24 open — requires `yarn db:migrate → seed → seed-extras → seed-patterns` before merge (migration 0022 has critical backfill).

## Prior Shipped Milestone: v2.1 — Regex Discovery & Transaction Unification (shipped 2026-06-22)

**Goal:** Re-architect regex discovery as a separate step downstream of auto-categorization, removing duplicate and already-covered proposals, with a reusable trigger and a cleaned-up import summary.

**Delivered:**
- Standalone `discoverRegexCandidates` service operating on post-categorization Set B only; no fileId or import context required; platform-specific normalization strip applied before clustering.
- Two-list `DiscoveryResult`: `candidates` (genuine prefix+variable families) and `singleCategorizationSuggestions` (identical-after-normalization groups). Check 1 (active-pattern dedup) and Check 2 (manual-history hash dedup) gates applied before output.
- `promoteSuggestionAction` resolves `platformId` server-side from `fileId` (IDOR guard); calls `applyNewPatternToPlatformExpenses` (platform-scoped Set B apply); returns inline Italian count copy on the suggestion card.
- `discoverRegexCandidates` reachable from two entry points: auto post-import non-fatal run with `discoveryCount` CTA (TRIG-01), and per-row "Ricontrolla regex" via `recheckRegexAction` from the Files table (TRIG-02).
- `detectPatternSuggestions` removed; `sampleRows` capped at 10; `SuggestionSection` with distinct headings + intro text; SUMUI-03 discovery-step paragraph.

**Status:** All 5 phases (51–55) shipped. 14/14 requirements satisfied (v2.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md: passed). Operator deploy (R038/R039/R041) remains operator-pending.

## Last Shipped Milestone: v2.0 — Nature/Direction Model Realignment (shipped 2026-06-14)

**Goal:** Replace the dual-axis `category.type` + `nature` classification with a single nature→direction model backed by lookup tables, migrate and recategorize all existing data, and add explicit transaction pairing on top of the implicit netting.

**Target features:**
- **NATURE-TABLE-01** — `direction`(4) + `nature`(9) lookup tables, `sub_category.nature_id` FK; remove `category.type` / `flow_nature` / `amount_sign` (supersedes ADR 0008); dissolve & rename categories and subcategories per `.planning/nature-remapping-WORKING.md` (23 categories · ~65 subcategories · 9 natures); rework `seed-data`/`seed-extras`; migrate + recategorize existing transactions; update dashboard/KPI/cascade/filters to direction + algebraic sum (4-direction view incl. `allocation`); deprecate `exclude_from_totals` in favour of `direction.included_in_totals`.
- **TX-PAIRING-01** — explicit transaction↔opposite linking (order↔refund), additive over the implicit subcategory netting (ADR 0004); ships as the final phase.

**Status:** all 5 phases complete (2026-06-14). Phase 50 (transaction-pairing, TX-PAIRING-01) shipped the explicit 1:1 order↔refund linking — `transaction_pair` table (migration 0020, applied), ownership-validating service (atomic, opposite-sign-enforced), shared `isNotSecondary()`/`effectiveAmount()` netting across all 8 dashboard aggregation sites, and the picker/badge/popover UI. Milestone v2.0 is ready for `/gsd-complete-milestone`.

**Design status:** LOCKED & certified. Contract: `docs/adr/0012-direction-derived-from-nature-allocation.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `.planning/nature-remapping-WORKING.md`. No discovery to redo.

**Prior milestone:** v1.16 (Dashboard Overview Redesign) shipped 2026-06-09; see `.planning/milestones/v1.16-ROADMAP.md`. EDU-FUT-01 (FlowNature taxonomy rename) is absorbed into NATURE-TABLE-01. Operator deploy R038/R039/R041 remain operator-pending.

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- Next.js 16 App Router with React 19 and server actions/route handlers.
- Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL, with SQL migrations generated by `drizzle-kit generate` and applied by `scripts/migrate.ts`; `drizzle-kit push` is not allowed in production.
- Better Auth with Drizzle adapter — email/password + Google/GitHub OAuth. Social providers activated by env vars only (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`). Account linking via `authClient.linkSocial` / `authClient.unlinkAccount`.
- Cloudflare R2 via S3-compatible SDK and presigned browser PUT uploads; upload diagnostics must not log presigned URLs, file contents, raw SDK/request objects, or credentials.
- Pino structured logging with optional Better Stack transport and AsyncLocalStorage request/user context propagation.
- `/api/health` is the operational diagnostic surface for DB and R2 readiness and always returns structured JSON.
- Developer-facing code, comments, route names, tests, and docs are English; Italian is allowed only for intentional product/domain surfaces.
- Decimal.js for all monetary arithmetic — never native `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` on amounts.
- Dashboard deviation: `computeDeviation` + `buildDeviationMap` in `lib/utils/dashboard.ts`; `getCategoryDeviations` DAL in `lib/dal/dashboard.ts`; Reference Period = last completed calendar month, Baseline = 3 months prior, noise threshold = €15.
- Settings navigation: `/settings` hub → `/settings/profile` (profile + linked accounts), `/settings/categories`; `/profile` is a compatibility redirect shim.
- Pattern suggestions follow `docs/adr/0002-pattern-suggestion-detection.md`: tokenize descriptions by whitespace, strip purely numeric tokens, emit longest common prefixes with at least 2 tokens and at least 2 uncategorized matches, infer `detectedAmountSign`, cap UI-facing suggestions at 5, and re-run post-import analysis from persisted transactions rather than raw R2 files.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Outcome | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Decimal.js for all monetary arithmetic | No native JS arithmetic on amounts throughout | ✓ Good |
| `drizzle-kit push` never in production | SQL migration files via `drizzle-kit generate` + `scripts/migrate.ts` | ✓ Good |
| Presigned PUT for R2 uploads | No file bytes proxied through server actions | ✓ Good |
| Better Auth + Drizzle pg adapter | Session checks only in edge proxy | ✓ Good |
| Import deduplication by descriptionHash | Handles overlapping bank exports | ✓ Good |
| Categorization tier gating (free/basic/pro) | Regex (T1) + history (T2) + AI (T3) | ✓ Good |
| Dashboard deviation: fixed Reference Period | Hardcoded last-month regardless of caller preset (D-02) | ✓ Good |
| Noise threshold €15 for deviation display | Micro-spend categories excluded from deviation | ✓ Good |
| MonthlyTrendChart deleted, two focused charts | Cleaner signal per chart (D-10/D-11/D-12) | ✓ Good |
| Sort default = deviation on categories page | Most actionable sort first; URL omits when default (D-07) | ✓ Good |
| OAuth activation via CLIENT_ID env var only | Presence of ID = activation signal; missing SECRET = loud crash at first use | ✓ Good |
| OAuth vars commented out in .env.example | Prevents accidental secret commit by copy-paste | ✓ Good |
| `canUnlink` checks credential OR other social | More robust than total-count check | ✓ Good |
| `configuredProviders` from process.env booleans | No NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars needed for provider visibility | ✓ Good |
| `/settings` hub + `/settings/profile` canonical | Settings IA extensible; `/profile` is a compat redirect shim | ✓ Good |
| Registration guardrail removed (REG-01) | `lib/auth/registration.ts` deleted; any OAuth account can register | ✓ Good |
| PatternSuggestion detector uses token-prefix grouping | Deterministic, readable regex prefixes without LLM cost or substring noise | ✓ Good |
| Dismissed pattern suggestions are ephemeral | Avoids schema complexity for low-frequency suggestion noise | ✓ Good |
| Post-import DAL uses `innerJoin` on `importFile` | Ownership enforced at query level; non-null `fileId` for all imported rows | ✓ Good |
| `promoteSuggestionAction` confidence hardcoded 0.85 | No UI knob; consistent with existing pattern confidence semantics | ✓ Good |
| `createPattern` reactivates soft-deleted user patterns on unique conflict | Prevents duplicate errors when user re-promotes a previously deleted pattern | ✓ Good |
| `nature` enum on `sub_category`, `effectiveNature` = COALESCE(override, seed default) | User override wins; system seed provides baseline; null = non classificato | ✓ Good |
| Onboarding routing gate in RSC layout (not proxy.ts) | Drizzle cannot run in Edge runtime; D-11 rationale documented | ✓ Good |
| `SubcategoryPicker` single output: `subCategoryId` | Uniform contract across commit-on-tap and fill-field surfaces | ✓ Good |
| `amountSign` on patterns derived server-side from subcategory's category type (ADR 0008) | Removes manual error-prone UI field; confidence hardcoded to 1 | ✓ Good |
| `getMostUsedSubcategories` DAL scoped per-user and by category type | Cold-start safe: section hidden when empty | ✓ Good |
| Overview chart variant A (grouped bars, no stack-by-nature, no balance series) | PO-approved design; reintroducing nature-stacks would undo the redesign clarity goal | ✓ Good |
| `income_extraordinary` mapped onto existing `nature` enum (in side) | Avoids schema change; income recurring = `income`, extraordinary = `income_extraordinary` | ✓ Good |
| KPI totals ignore chart filter chips | Filter chips answer "where does the money go?"; KPIs answer "how much in total?" — mixing would confuse both | ✓ Good |
| Uncategorized nudge in localStorage only (never DB) | Zero schema cost; per-session semantics acceptable for invitational nudge | ✓ Good |
| Per-month movers via recharts `onClick` on bar | Drill-down stays within the page; no route change or modal required | ✓ Good |
| `fetchMovers` server action (not DAL direct call from RSC) | Enables client-controlled month selection after initial SSR render | ✓ Good |
| Set B filter via `isNull(expense.subCategoryId)` | Covers uncategorized statuses without enumerating them; mirrors `applyNewPatternToExpenses` | ✓ Good |
| `discoverRegexCandidates` reads `descriptionStripPattern` from DAL join result | Platform-level constant available from first row; no separate config fetch | ✓ Good |
| Two-list `DiscoveryResult` (candidates + singleCategorizationSuggestions) | Additive shape; downstream UI and triggers receive both lists without re-querying | ✓ Good |
| Check 2 uses `expenseClassificationHistory source='manual'` | Covers the unique `(userId, descriptionHash)` constraint; not current expense state | ✓ Good |
| `platformId` resolved server-side from `fileId` in `promoteSuggestionAction` | IDOR guard: client never supplies platformId directly; dead prop removed from client chain | ✓ Good |
| Post-commit `discoverRegexCandidates` non-fatal (try/catch, `discoveryCount=0` on error) | Import always succeeds; discovery failure is logged but does not surface to user | ✓ Good |
| `recheckRegexAction` called as plain async fn (not `useActionState`) | Enables `router.push` after await without state machine complexity | ✓ Good |
| Parsing contract owned by `import_format_version`, not `platform` (ADR 0013) | `platform` = pure identity; real per-platform versioning expressible; two-step migration (ADD nullable → data copy → DROP) is safe | ✓ Good |
| Per-bank PDF template, not generic parser (ADR 0014) | "Almost-right" extraction on financial data is worse than no import; 2–3 concrete templates → abstraction emerges naturally | ✓ Good |
| `unpdf` for positional X-coordinate extraction, not `pdf-parse` | Serverless-ready; `pdf-parse` produces flat text with no coordinate info — cannot determine credit/debit sign | ✓ Good |
| Balance chain as explicit import guard for PDF | Any sign error halts import with explicit error; prevents silent bad data on tampered/malformed PDFs | ✓ Good |
| `PDF_IMPORT_PLATFORM_SLUGS` allowlist co-located with `.pdf` dispatch | Single source of truth for PDF-capable banks; no `fileType` column on `import_format_version` (avoids scope creep) | ✓ Good |
| `UNRECOGNIZED_PDF_FORMAT` — single constant for both machine code and Italian fallback | No separate enum; action intercepts the code and enriches with platform list; no internal markers leaked to UI | ✓ Good |
| Single-transaction detach re-hashes the existing expense row in place (no new expense) (ADR 0016) | Multi-tx detach path would leave the source expense orphaned when it held only one transaction; in-place UPDATE avoids the orphan by construction, preserving classification history on the same row/id | ✓ Good |
| Standalone-expense isolation is a general categorization action, not a "money from a person" category | Classifying by counterparty violates CONTEXT.md's categorization rule #1 (by purpose, not by who) and isn't reliably auto-detectable | ✓ Good |
| Row title display precedence: `customTitle → expenseTitle → description` | Latent gap surfaced by v2.4: expense.title updates on standalone-rename but the row kept showing raw bank description, since TransactionTitleEdit never read expenseTitle. Fixed display-only; `transaction.description`/descriptionHash/aggregation/Tier 2 untouched | ✓ Good |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
